# Install and Run Agents

The agent software runs on your own infrastructure. Agent pool membership is determined by which token you provide when starting the agent.


## Operational Considerations

The agent is distributed as a standalone binary which can be run on any supported system. By default, the agent will run in the foreground as a long-running process that will continuously poll for workloads from Terraform Cloud. We strongly recommend pairing the agent with a process supervisor to ensure that it is automatically restarted in case of an error.

Agents do not guarantee a clean working environment per Terraform execution. Each execution is performed in its own temporary directory with a clean environment, but references to absolute file paths or other machine state may cause interference between Terraform executions. We strongly recommend that you write your Terraform code to be stateless and idempotent. You may also want to consider using [single-execution mode](#optional-configuration-single-execution-mode) to ensure your agent only runs a single workload.

## Download and Install the Agent

1. Download the latest [agent release](https://releases.hashicorp.com/tfc-agent/), the associated checksum file (.SHA256sums), and the checksum signature (.sig).
1. Verify the integrity of the downloaded archive, as well as the signature of the `SHA256SUMS` file using the instructions available on [HashiCorp's security page](https://www.hashicorp.com/security).
1. Extract the release archive. The `unzip` utility is available on most Linux distributions and may be invoked as `unzip <archive file>`. Two individual binaries will be extracted (`tfc-agent` and `tfc-agent-core`). These binaries _must_ reside in the same directory for the agent to function properly.

### Updating

By default, the agent will automatically update itself to the latest minor version. Administrators are required to update the host operating system and all other installed software.

To customize this update behavior, pass the flag `-auto-update` or set the environment variable `TFC_AGENT_AUTO_UPDATE`. The valid options are presented in the table below.

| Update Setting | Behavior                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `minor`        | Matches the default behavior, automatically update the agent to the latest minor version.                    |
| `patch`        | The agent will only be updated to the newest patch version, new minor versions will require a manual update. |
| `disabled`     | Disables automatic updates, all updates will be manual.

## Start the Agent

Using the Agent token you copied earlier, set the `TFC_AGENT_TOKEN` and `TFC_AGENT_NAME` environment variables.

```
export TFC_AGENT_TOKEN=your-token
export TFC_AGENT_NAME=your-agent-name
./tfc-agent
```

-> **Note:** The `TFC_AGENT_NAME` variable is optional. If you do not specify a name here, one will not be displayed. These names are for your reference only, and the agent ID is what will appear in logs and API requests.

Once complete, your agent will appear on the Agents page and display its current status.

### Optional Configuration: Running an Agent using Docker

Alternatively, you can use our official agent Docker container to run the Agent.

```
docker pull hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest
docker run -e TFC_AGENT_TOKEN=your-token -e
TFC_AGENT_NAME=your-agent-name hashicorp/tfc-agent
```

This Docker image executes the tfc-agent process as the non-root tfc-agent user. For some workflows, such as those that require the ability to install software via apt-get during local-exec scripts, you may need to build a customized version of the agent Docker image for your internal use.

```Dockerfile
FROM hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest

USER root

# Install sudo. The container runs as a non-root user, but people may rely on
# the ability to apt-get install things.
RUN apt-get -y install sudo

# Permit tfc-agent to use sudo apt-get commands.
RUN echo 'tfc-agent ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get , /usr/bin/apt' >> /etc/sudoers.d/50-tfc-agent

USER tfc-agent
```

An image customized in this way will permit installation of additional software via sudo apt-get.

## Stop the Agent

The agent maintains a registration and a liveness indicator within Terraform Cloud during the entire course of its runtime. When an agent is to be retired, it must deregister itself from Terraform Cloud. The agent performs deregistration automatically as part of its shutdown procedure in the following scenarios:

- If using an interactive terminal, Ctrl-C is pressed.
- One of `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, or `SIGQUIT` is sent to the agent process ID. It is important to send only one signal. If a second signal is received by the agent, it is interpreted as a forceful termination signal and will cause the agent to exit immediately.

In both cases, after initiating a graceful shutdown, the terminal user or parent program should wait for the agent to exit. The amount of time this takes depends on the agent's current workload. The agent will wait for any current operations to complete before deregistering and exiting.

It is highly recommended that the agent is only terminated using one of the above methods. Abruptly terminating an agent by forcefully killing the process, power cycling the host, etc., will not provide the agent the opportunity to deregister, and will result in an **Unknown** agent status. This may cause further capacity issues, as outlined below in [Agent Capacity Usage](#agent-capacity-usage).

### Optional Configuration: Single-execution mode

The Agent can also be configured to run in single-execution mode, which will ensure that the Agent only runs a single workload, then terminates. This can be used in combination with Docker and a process supervisor to ensure a clean working environment for every Terraform run.

To use single-execution mode, start the agent with the `-single` command line argument.
