# Monitor Log Output

You may want to monitor Terraform Cloud Agent output.

## View Agent Logs

Output from the Terraform execution will be visible on the run’s page within Terraform Cloud. For more in-depth debugging, you may wish to view the agent’s logs, which are sent to `stdout` and configurable via the `-log-level` command line argument. By default, these logs are not persisted in any way. It is the responsibility of the operator to collect and store these logs if they are needed.

## Flash Messages

Flash Messages are a type of log that HashiCorp may send to agents from time to time. These messages may be used to communicate important or breaking changes to the agent. Flash Messages will be emitted when HashiCorp adds a new one, or when starting up an agent for the first time. Their output looks something like:

```
2021-09-22T15:20:59.269Z [WARN]  core.notice: A breaking change is incoming.
```

Flash Messages are version specific, and may only apply to the specific version of the agent you are running.

Adding monitoring and alerting for these `core.notice` messages may help you operate Terraform Cloud Agents more easily.
