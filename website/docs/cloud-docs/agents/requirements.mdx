  Supported operating systems, Terraform versions, hardware requirements, and networking requirements for Terraform Cloud Agents.

# Requirements
~> Important: All agents in an agent pool should have the same operating system and hardware resources available. If the agents are using different resources, run performance can vary significantly between each agent in the pool.

Ensure your system meets the following requirements before installing and configuring Terraform Cloud Agents. Refer to [Terraform Cloud Agents on TFE](/terraform/enterprise/admin/agents-on-tfe) for additional Terraform Enterprise requirements.

## Supported Operating Systems

[Agents](https://releases.hashicorp.com/tfc-agent/) currently only support x86_64 bit Linux operating systems. You can also run the agent within Docker using our official [Terraform Cloud Agent Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent).

## Supported Terraform Versions

Agents support Terraform versions 0.12 and above. Workspaces configured to use Terraform versions below 0.12 cannot select the agent-based execution mode.

## Hardware Requirements

The host running the agent has varying resource requirements depending on the workspaces the agent will serve and the agent's configuration. A host can be a dedicated or shared cloud instance, virtual machine, bare metal server, or a container. You should monitor and adjust memory, CPU, and disk space based on each workspace's usage and performance.

Use the following specifications as a reference:

- At least 4GB of free disk space
  - Each run requires the agent to temporarily store local copies of the tarred repository, extracted repository, state file, any providers or modules, and the Terraform binary itself.
  - When using agents for private VCS operations, a good rule of thumb is to ensure the agent has storage capacity equal to at least twice the maximum expected repository size.
- At least 2GB of system memory
  - The agent runtime itself will utilize memory during uploading and downloading ofvarious artifacts, constructing temporary execution environments, parsing configurations, etc.
  - Running operations (`terraform plan`, `git clone`, `sentinel apply`, etc.), will utilize memory to facilitate various workflows.
  - Request forwarding may hold multiple requests and responses in memory until they are successfully executed and relayed to Terraform Cloud. It is good practice to add at least 100mb of additional memory when request forwarding is enabled.

## Networking Requirements

In order for an agent to function properly, it must be able to make outbound TCP connections to the Terraform Cloud application APIs. These requests may require perimeter networking as well as container host networking changes, depending on your environment. Refer to the [Terraform Cloud IP Ranges documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/ip-ranges) for more details on the IP ranges.

Additionally, the agent must also be able to communicate with any services required by the Terraform code it is executing. This includes the Terraform releases distribution service, [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com), as well as any provider APIs. The following services run on these IP ranges:

| Hostname               | Port/Protocol  | Directionality | Purpose                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app.terraform.io       | tcp/443, HTTPS | Outbound       | Polling for new workloads, providing status updates, and downloading private modules from Terraform Cloud's Private Module Registry |
| registry.terraform.io  | tcp/443, HTTPS | Outbound       | Downloading public modules from the Terraform Registry                                                                              |
