# Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following requirements before installing and configuring Terraform Cloud Agents.

-> **Note:** Refer to [Terraform Cloud Agents on TFE](/enterprise/admin/agents-on-tfe) for additional Terraform Enterprise requirements.


## Supported Operating Systems

[Agents](https://releases.hashicorp.com/tfc-agent/) currently only support x86_64 bit Linux operating systems. You can also run the agent within Docker using our official [Terraform Agent Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent).

## Supported Terraform Versions

Agents support Terraform versions 0.12 and above. Workspaces configured to use Terraform versions below 0.12 will not be able to select the agent-based execution mode.

## Hardware Requirements

The host running the agent will have varying resource requirements depending on the workspace. A host can be a dedicated or shared cloud instance, virtual machine, bare metal server, or a container. You should monitor and adjust memory, CPU, and disk space based on each workspace's usage and performance. The name of your instance type may vary depending on your deployment environment.

You can use the specs below as a reference:

- At least 4GB of free disk space
  - Each run requires the agent to temporarily store local copies of the tarred repository, extracted repository, state file, any providers or modules, and the Terraform binary itself.
- At least 2GB of system memory

## Networking Requirements

In order for an agent to function properly, it must be able to make outbound requests over HTTPS (TCP port 443) to the Terraform Cloud application APIs. This may require perimeter networking as well as container host networking changes, depending on your environment. The IP ranges are documented in the [Terraform Cloud IP Ranges documentation](/cloud-docs/architectural-details/ip-ranges).

Additionally, the agent must also be able to communicate with any services required by the Terraform code it is executing. This includes the Terraform releases distribution service, [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com) (supported by [Fastly](https://api.fastly.com/public-ip-list)), as well as any provider APIs. The services which run on these IP ranges are described in the table below.
