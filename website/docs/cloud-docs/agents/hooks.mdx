# Agent Hooks

HCP Terraform Agents support running custom programs, or _hooks_, during
strategic points of a Terraform run. These hooks allow you to extend the
functionality of Terraform runs. For example, you may create a hook to
dynamically download software required by the Terraform run or send an HTTP
request to a system to kick off an external workflow.

## Supported Hooks

HCP Terraform Agents support the following hooks:

- `pre-plan` - Runs before `terraform init` during a `plan` operation.

- `post-plan` - Runs after `terraform plan` during a `plan` operation
	regardless of whether or not `terraform plan` completed successfully.

- `pre-apply` - Runs before `terraform init` during an `apply` operation.

- `post-apply` - Runs after `terraform apply` during an `apply` operation
	regardless of whether or not `terraform apply` completed successfully.

## Hook Behavior 

Please note the following behavior when using hooks:

- If a hook exits with a non-zero exit code, the Terraform run will fail
	immediately.
- The standard output and standard error from the hook will be printed
	alongside the Terraform run output in the HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise user
	interface.
- The hook name must match one of the [supported hooks](#supported-hooks). You
	cannot customize or change these names. Because of this, there can only be
	one hook of each type configured for each agent. For example, you could
	create a `pre-plan` and `pre-apply` hook, but you cannot create two
	`pre-plan` hooks.
- Each hook must have the execute permission set.
- Each hook has a default timeout of 60 seconds and a max timeout of 10 minutes. 
  You can configure hook timeouts using global timeouts or hook-specific timeouts. 
  You can set the value of any hook timeout in seconds. If a hook times out, the Terraform 
  run fails immediately.
    - To set global timeouts, use the `TFC_AGENT_HOOK_TIMEOUT` environment variable.
    - To set hook-specific timeouts, use an environment variable with the hook’s name 
      `TFC_AGENT_HOOK_[HOOK NAME]_TIMEOUT`. For example, you can set the timeout for the 
      pre-plan hook to 2 minutes by setting `TFC_AGENT_HOOK_PRE_PLAN_TIMEOUT=120`.
      A hook-specific timeout takes precedence over the global hook timeout.
- Terraform environment variables do not persist across hooks. For example, if a
  `pre-plan` hook exports environment variables, they will not be available
  during the `post-plan` hook. Similarly, if `terraform plan` exports
  environment variables, they will not be available during the `post-plan` hook.

## Setting Terraform Environment Variables

Hooks may be used to set environment variables for subsequent `terraform`
commands to use. To set an environment variable, write lines in `KEY=value`
format to the file pointed to by the `$TFC_AGENT_ENV` environment variable.
Newlines are used to separate multiple environment variables. For example, to
set the `FOO` and `BAR` environment variables for the `terraform plan` operation
to consume, write the following in a `pre-plan` hook script:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo FOO=hello >> $TFC_AGENT_ENV
echo BAR=world >> $TFC_AGENT_ENV
```

Environment variables set by a hook script in this way are only applicable to
the current operation, and are not persisted for later operations. For example,
if `FOO=bar` is set in the `pre-plan` hook, then `FOO=bar` will be set during
the `terraform plan` command, but will not be set during `terraform apply`. To
use the variable during the apply phase, write the variable to the
`$TFC_AGENT_ENV` file again in the `pre-apply` hook script.

## Configuration

Hooks are stored within the `hooks` subdirectory of the agent's data directory.
By default, that's `~/.tfc-agent/hooks`.

To configure a hook, create a file named `terraform-${HOOK}` where `${HOOK}`
is one of the hooks listed above. Then store that file within the `hooks`
subdirectory and make it executable. The agent will trigger configured hooks
at the appropriate points during Terraform runs.

For example, a `pre-plan` hook is an executable file named
`~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan`. When this hook is configured, an agent
will run this hook before `terraform init` during a `plan` operation.

### Running an Agent as a Binary

To configure hooks when running the `tfc-agent` binary directly on a Linux
instance:

1. Create the `hooks` directory within the agent's data directory.

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/.tfc-agent/hooks
  ```

1. Create one or more hooks inside the `hooks` directory. The following
example creates a `pre-plan` hook that prints a message when it runs.

  ```sh
  cat <<EOF > ~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Example hook output."
  EOF
  ```

1. Make the hooks executable.

  ```sh
  chmod +x ~/.tfc-agent/hooks/terraform-pre-plan
  ```

1. Start the agent.

  ```sh
  tfc-agent
  ```

1. The agent will now trigger configured hooks at the appropriate points
during Terraform runs. The standard output and standard error from the hook
will be printed alongside the Terraform run in the HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise
user interface.

  ```
  Terraform v1.1.0
  Executing pre-plan hook...
  Example hook output.
  Initializing plugins and modules...
  ```

### Running an Agent with Docker 

When running `tfc-agent` using Docker, you must build a new Docker image
containing the hooks. To configure hooks:

1. Create a new directory and navigate into it. This limits the Docker build
context to this new directory.

  ```sh
  mkdir hooks-docker-example
  cd hooks-docker-example
  ```

1. Create a `hooks` directory.

  ```sh
  mkdir hooks
  ```

1. Create one or more hooks inside the `hooks` directory. The following
example creates a `pre-plan` hook that prints a message when it runs.

  ```sh
  cat <<EOF > hooks/terraform-pre-plan
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Example hook output."
  EOF
  ```

1. Make the hooks executable.

  ```sh
  chmod +x hooks/terraform-pre-plan
  ```

1. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content.

  ```
  FROM hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest
  RUN mkdir /home/tfc-agent/.tfc-agent
  ADD --chown=tfc-agent:tfc-agent hooks /home/tfc-agent/.tfc-agent/hooks
  ```

1. Build a new `hashicorp/tfc-agent` Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.

  ```
  docker build -t hashicorp/tfc-agent:your-tag .
  ```

1. Start the agent using the Docker image.

  ```sh
  docker run -e TFC_AGENT_TOKEN=your-token -e TFC_AGENT_NAME=your-agent-name \
    hashicorp/tfc-agent:your-tag
  ```

1. The agent will now trigger configured hooks at the appropriate points
during Terraform runs. The standard output and standard error from the hook
will be printed alongside the Terraform run in the HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise
user interface.

  ```
  Terraform v1.1.0
  Executing pre-plan hook...
  Example hook output.
  Initializing plugins and modules...
  ```
