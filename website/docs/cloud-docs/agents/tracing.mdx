# Tracing

The agent emits tracing spans that can be consumed by various distributed
tracing tools. Information about supported tools can be found on the
[OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/). A span is a
single unit of work performed by the agent.

Spans conform to the following rules:

* Each span has a unique name in plain English, explaining what it represents.
  Due to this descriptive nature of spans, individual trace spans are not
  documented on this page.
* Span attributes will be made up of sections, separated by periods. Sections
  will contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
  For example: `run.terraform-version`.
* Span attributes in the `debug` namespace will have information relevant to
  the current span's scope.
