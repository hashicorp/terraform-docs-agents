# Tracing

The agent emits tracing spans that can be consumed by various distributed
tracing tools. Information about supported tools can be found on the
[OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/). A span describes
a single, concise unit of work performed by the agent, such as writing a file
or downloading an artifact.

## Span names

Each span has a unique name in plain English, explaining what it represents.
Due to this descriptive nature of spans, individual trace spans are not
documented on this page.

## Span attributes

Span attribute keys typically contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
In some cases, span attributes may contain dots (`.`) to provide structure to a
set of related attributes.

Span attributes in the `debug` namespace will have information relevant to the
current span's scope.
