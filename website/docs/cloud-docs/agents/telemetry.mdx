# Telemetry

Terraform Cloud Agents may be configured to emit helpful telemetry data,
including both trace spans and metrics.

## Telemetry architecture

Terraform Cloud Agents emit telemetry data using the
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) protocol. The agent is a simple
producer of telemetry data, and relies on an OpenTelemetry Collector to perform
aggregation, post-processing, and exporting of telemetry data to upstream
technology and/or vendors. OpenTelemetry is an extensible telemetry protocol and
open source platform, which enables the Terraform Cloud Agent to remain
vendor-agnostic while producing high-value telemetry data for a wide array
of platforms.

## Agent Configuration

To configure your agent to emit telemetry data, you must include the
`-otlp-address` flag or `TFC_AGENT_OTLP_ADDRESS` environment variable. This
should be set to the host:port address of an [OpenTelemetry
collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/data-collection/). This
address should be a GRPC server running an OLTP collector.

Optionally, you can pass the `-otlp-cert-file` or `TFC_AGENT_OTLP_CERT_FILE`.
The agent will use a certificate at the path supplied to encrypt the client
connection to the OpenTelemetry collector. When omitted, client connections are
not secured.

## Tracing

The agent emits tracing spans which are useful in understanding and debugging
various operations performed by the Terraform Cloud Agent.

See the [Tracing](./tracing) documentation for details.

## Metrics

Terraform Cloud Agents emit granular metrics which are useful in understanding
the behavior and performance of various operations in a high-level, aggregated
view.

See the [Metrics](./metrics) documentation for details.
