# Telemetry

HCP Terraform Agents may be configured to emit helpful telemetry data,
including both trace spans and metrics.

## Telemetry architecture

HCP Terraform Agents emit telemetry data using the
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) protocol. The agent is a simple
producer of telemetry data, and relies on an OpenTelemetry Collector to perform
aggregation, post-processing, and exporting of telemetry data to upstream
technology and/or vendors. OpenTelemetry is an extensible telemetry protocol and
open source platform, which enables the HCP Terraform Agent to remain
vendor-agnostic while producing high-value telemetry data for a wide array
of platforms.

## Agent Configuration

To configure your agent to emit telemetry data, you must include the
`-otlp-address` flag or `TFC_AGENT_OTLP_ADDRESS` environment variable. This
should be set to the host:port address of an [OpenTelemetry
collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/data-collection/). This
address should be a GRPC server running an OLTP collector.

Optionally, you can pass the `-otlp-cert-file` or `TFC_AGENT_OTLP_CERT_FILE`.
The agent will use a certificate at the path supplied to encrypt the client
connection to the OpenTelemetry collector. When omitted, client connections are
not secured.

## OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector has a pluggable architecture. This opens up the
ecosystem and makes it possible to leverage a wide array of telemetry platforms
and technologies. The OpenTelemetry project distributes the collector in two
flavors: `core` and `contrib`. For most uses, the `contrib` distribution will
be most useful, as it includes a wide array of integrations for specific
telemetry platforms and technologies which are not available in the `core`
distribution. The `contrib` distribution is available as a pre-packaged
Docker container labeled
[otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).

## Compatibility

Each released version of the HCP Terraform Agent ships with a specific version
of the OpenTelemetry client libraries built in. As these libraries and
implementations change, it is possible that certain versions of the agent will
become incompatible with newer versions of the OpenTelemetry collector. To
track version compatibility, the table below will be updated whenever these
version constraints become known.

| HCP Terraform Agent version | Compatible OpenTelemetry Collector version |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| >= 0.1.12, <= 1.7.0           | <= 0.42.0                                  |
| >= 1.7.1                      | Tested up to 0.73.0                        |

### Running the collector

By default, the `contrib` distribution accepts telemetry from a wide variety of
sources, and dumps information about the metrics and traces collected to stdout.
To start the collector with default settings, run the following command:

```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:4317:4317/tcp otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.42.0
```

This will start an OpenTelemetry collector, and expose the gRPC interface (which
the HCP Terraform Agent can talk to) on port 4317 of the local machine.

### Configuring the collector

The OpenTelemetry collector takes configuration in the form of a YAML file. It
may be useful to refer to the default YAML configuration file as a starting
point for your own configuration. Its source may be found
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/blob/main/configs/otelcol-contrib.yaml).

To tweak the configuration, save your custom YAML configuration to a file on
disk called `collector.yaml`, and run the collector container with the
following command:

```
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=${PWD}/collector.yml,target=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4317:4317/tcp \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.42.0
```

The collector should start with your modified configuration.

## DataDog Agent

The HCP Terraform Agent may target a DataDog agent directly instead of an
OpenTelemetry collector. To configure the DataDog agent to accept OTLP
connections, refer to the [DataDog OpenTelemetry
documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent).
Note that the tfc-agent talks to a gRPC OTLP receiver only. Be sure to
configure the DataDog agent to accept a gRPC OTLP connection. Once the
DataDog agent is listening for gRPC connections, [configure the tfc-agent] using
the address of the DataDog agent's gRPC listener in place of the OpenTelemetry
collector address.

## Tracing

The agent emits tracing spans which are useful in understanding and debugging
various operations performed by the HCP Terraform Agent.

See the [Tracing](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/tracing) documentation for details.

## Metrics

HCP Terraform Agents emit granular metrics which are useful in understanding
the behavior and performance of various operations in a high-level, aggregated
view.

See the [Metrics](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/metrics) documentation for details.

## Categories

Telemetry data can be broken down into three categories, global, Terraform, and policy.

### Global
Once an Agent has registered, global fields are present on telemetry.

| Telemetry Key            | Description                             | Example Value      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `agent_id`               | Unique identifier for an agent.         | "agent-xxx"        |
| `agent_name`             | Name of an agent.                       | "agent1"           |
| `agent_version`          | Semantic version of agent.              | "1.7.1"            |
| `agent_pool_id`          | Unique identifier for an agent pool.    | "apool-xxx"        |

### Terraform
Terraform fields are present on telemetry once an Agent begins handling a Terraform run.

| Telemetry Key            | Description                              | Example Value     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `organization_name`      | Name of an organization.                 | "organization1"   |
| `run_id`                 | Unique identifier for a Terraform run.   | "run-xxx"         |
| `run_operation`          | Terraform operation.                     | "apply"           |
| `workspace_name`         | Name of a workspace.                     | "workspace1"      |

### Policy
Policy fields are present on telemetry once an Agent begins handling policy evaluation.

| Telemetry Key            | Description                               | Example Value    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `policy_evaluation_id`   | Unique identifier for a policy evaluation.| "poleval-xxx"    |
