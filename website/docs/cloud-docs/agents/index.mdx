# HCP Terraform Agents

@include 'agents.mdx'

HCP Terraform Agents allow HCP Terraform to communicate with isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure. By deploying lightweight agents within a specific network segment, you can establish a simple connection between your environment and HCP Terraform which allows for provisioning operations and management. This is useful for on-premises infrastructure types such as vSphere, Nutanix, OpenStack, enterprise networking providers, and anything you might have in a protected enclave.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Manage Private Environments with HCP Terraform Agents](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-agents) tutorial.

The agent only requires outbound connectivity to HCP Terraform, enabling private networks to remain secure and typically requiring no special networking configuration or exceptions.

## Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise supports HCP Terraform Agents. Refer to
[HCP Terraform Agents on Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/agents-on-tfe) for Terraform Enterprise specific documentation and requirements.
