# Terraform Cloud Agents

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Manage Private Environments with Terraform Cloud Agents](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-agents) tutorial.

-> **Note:** Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for more information about Terraform Cloud Agents.

Terraform Cloud Agents allow Terraform Cloud to communicate with isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure. By deploying lightweight agents within a specific network segment, you can establish a simple connection between your environment and Terraform Cloud which allows for provisioning operations and management. This is useful for on-premises infrastructure types such as vSphere, Nutanix, OpenStack, enterprise networking providers, and anything you might have in a protected enclave.

The agent only requires outbound connectivity to Terraform Cloud, enabling private networks to remain secure and typically requiring no special networking configuration or exceptions.

## Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise supports Terraform Cloud Agents. Refer to
[Terraform Cloud Agents on TFE](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/agents-on-tfe) for Terraform Enterprise specific documentation and requirements.
