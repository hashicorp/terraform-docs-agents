# Logging

You may want to monitor Terraform Cloud Agent output.

## Agent Logs

Output from the Terraform execution is available on the run details page in Terraform Cloud. For more in-depth debugging, you may wish to view the agentâ€™s logs, which are sent to `stdout` and configurable via the `-log-level` command line argument. By default, the agent does not persist these logs in any way. You must collect and store these logs if necessary.

## Flash Messages

Flash Messages are a type of log that HashiCorp may send to agents from time to time. These messages may be used to communicate important or breaking changes to the agent. Flash Messages will be emitted when HashiCorp adds a new one, or when starting up an agent for the first time. Their output looks something like:

```
2021-09-22T15:20:59.269Z [WARN]  core.notice: A breaking change is incoming.
```

Flash Messages are version specific, and may only apply to the specific version of the agent you are running.

Adding monitoring and alerting for these `core.notice` messages may help you operate Terraform Cloud Agents more easily.
