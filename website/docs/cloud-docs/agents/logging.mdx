# Logging

Terraform Cloud Agents log helpful messages which enable operators to understand
agent behavior, including communication with Terraform Cloud APIs, specific
commands run, actions taken, and runtime management.

## Log output

Terraform Cloud Agents write log messages directly to stdout/stderr. This
provides flexibility to the operator for capturing the logs in a variety of
different logging systems, and a very simple experience for CLI users who wish
to see a log of the agent's behavior directly in their terminal. By default,
the agent does not automatically persist the log output in any way. The user
must direct the log output to a file or collect them with a process or
container supervisor if persistence is required.

## Log verbosity and levels

The volume of logs and the level of detail they contain are controlled by log
levels. There are 5 levels supported by the agent:

* `error` contains only critical error messages. The agent process is otherwise
  silent.
* `warn` contains all error-level messages, as well as informational messages
  such as system messages directly from the Terraform Cloud platform.
* `info` contains all warn-level messages and high-level information about the
  agent and the workflows it is executing. In normal circumstances, this is
  the safest and most helpful log level for day to day operation.
* `debug` contains all info-level messages, plus additional informational
  messages which provide further context about behavior, data, and events.
* `trace` contains all debug-level messages, plus verbose process logs such as
  the line-by-line output of the `terraform` command.

## Data format

By default, Terraform Cloud Agents emit log lines in a human-friendly text
format. This is convenient for running the tfc-agent locally and streaming the
logs directly to a terminal, or for use in log systems where raw logs are
consumed directly by operators. The default text format looks something like
the following:

```
2023-01-26T13:45:02.502-0800 [INFO]  core: Job received: job.type=plan job.id=run-xxx
```

It is also possible to configure the Terraform Cloud Agent to produce JSON-
formatted logs. This format will cause each log line to be serialized as an
individual JSON object, and is more ideal for logging systems which are capable
of parsing and performing post-processing on log data for each line. JSON
logging mode is enabled by passing the `-log-json` CLI flag, or setting the
environment variable `TFC_AGENT_LOG_JSON=1`. The JSON format contains additional
verbose information in each log message, and looks something like this:

```
{"@level":"info","@message":"Job received","@module":"core","@timestamp":"2023-01-26T13:47:20.637933-08:00","agent.id":"agent-xxx","agent.pool.id":"apool-xxx","agent.version":"1.6.0","job.id":"run-xxx","job.type":"plan"}
```

## Log data sensitivity

Log levels have a progressive level of data sensitivy. The `info`, `warn`, and
`error` levels are considered generally safe for log collection and don't
include sensitive information. The `debug` log level may include internal
system details, such as specific commands and arguments including paths to user
data on the local filesystem.  The `trace` log level is the most sensitive and
may include personally identifiable information, secrets, pre-authorized
internal URLs, and other sensitive material.

## Flash Messages

Flash Messages are a type of log that HashiCorp may send to agents from time to time. These messages may be used to communicate important or breaking changes to the agent. Flash Messages will be emitted when HashiCorp adds a new one, or when starting up an agent for the first time. Their output looks something like:

```
2021-09-22T15:20:59.269Z [WARN]  core.notice: A breaking change is incoming.
```

Flash Messages are version specific, and may only apply to the specific version of the agent you are running.

Adding monitoring and alerting for these `core.notice` messages may help you operate Terraform Cloud Agents more easily.
